To exectute a demo FastAPI project :

    First Install the libraries as in requirement.txt.

    Create A app object in a python app and set the routes for that application with some message to return/display.

    Run this command in terminal :   uvicorn main:app --reload 
    # Reload so that the webserver automatically reloads when detected changes.
    #Also we can check for changes and request actively in terminal with the help of above command.

    #NOTE: main is the file_name for the python code which contains the app object.

    A localhost link will be visible in terminal , clicking it we will be redirected to the page
    # If we need to switch to other routes we can specify the route in the above address bar of the browser
    for example : if we made a '/about' route than : path/about will redirect to the about logic.

    To check the documentation go to route : path/docs
